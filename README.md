## What is Lisa?
Lisa is focus assistant that doesn't suck. It helps you focus longer and work better.

Lisa helps you break down work into manageable time intervals for focusing,
separated by short and long breaks. It adds a timer to all webpages you visit,
keeping you aware of how much time is left in your current interval.
