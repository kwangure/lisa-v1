## What is Lisa?
Lisa helps you break down work into manageable time intervals for focusing,
separated by short and long breaks. It adds a timer to all webpages you visit,
keeping you aware of how much time is left in your current interval.

## Features
- Hide the persistent timer in a particular tab using Alt+Shift+Down and reveal it with
Alt+Shift+Up
- Extend your current focus interval if you need just a few more minutes to finish what
you're working on.
- Configure how long your focus intervals are
- Configure the length of your short and long breaks
- Enable/Disable desktop notifications
