## What is Lisa?
Lisa is focus assistant that doesn't suck. It helps you focus longer and work better.

Lisa helps you break down work into manageable time intervals for focusing,
separated by short and long breaks. It adds a timer to all webpages you visit,
keeping you aware of how much time is left in your current interval.

## Development
After cloning from Github, run `npm install` to finish setup.

Use `npm run dev` to output a `dev` folder. In Chrome, under the extensions page, select "Load Unpacked" and pick the `dev` folder. Make sure Developer Mode is on, if you do not see this button.

**TIP**: Close any tabs you're not using. The extension will reload all pages when you make changes in dev mode.
